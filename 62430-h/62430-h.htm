<p><span class="smcap">Philip Hale</span>, the well-known and brilliant
Boston literary and musical critic writes as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Walter Blackburn Harte is beyond doubt and peradventure
the leading essayist in Boston today. For Boston perhaps you
had better read &#8216;the United States.&#8217; His matter is original
and brave, his style is clear, polished when effect is to be gained
thereby, blunt when the blow of the bludgeon should fall, and at
times delightfully whimsical, rambling, paradoxical, fantastical.
But read for yourself, Miss Eustacia; and Harte&#8217;s &#8216;Meditations
in Motley&#8217; will remain one of your favorite books. And now
Mr. Harte is the editor of <span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>. The first number is
out, and let us earnestly call your attention to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A vigorous writer and thoroughly animated by the idea that
the field of letters in this country should bloom with the genius
of its youth. If <span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span> doesn&#8217;t achieve a great success
it will not be for lack of talent and energy on the part of its
director.&mdash;<i>The Boston Traveller.</i></p>

<p>A new and wholly up to date brochure, <span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>, has
just appeared under the conductorship of Walter Blackburn
Harte, one of the brightest young men in American literature.&mdash;<i>The
Boston Home Journal.</i></p>

<p>Promises to be something of a novelty in periodical literature,
for it is filled with piquant comments on current fads and fashions,
and contains some spicy and whimsical essays in miniature,
written in a vivid impressionistic manner.&mdash;<i>The Boston
Transcript.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">THE VISION OF YOUTH.</h2></div>


<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_001.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>It may be accepted as an axiom that the strong
are always audacious, and so when we hear of
any man in literature who is shocking and rumpling
all the susceptibilities of nice, quiet, drowsy
people we may be sure that his capital crime is
independence of thought and opinion. He is
looking at life for himself, instead of through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the refracted lenses of old class habit or antiquated
religious dogma. And it is a thousand to
one he has the criminal audacity to be young;
for the vision of youth is clearer and more sure,
and more pitying than the old green or crimson
goggles of selfish age, that would paint the world
as popes and kings and classes and governments,
with rewards and honors to give, would have it.
All men whose life and work make for the uplifting
of human conditions and thought are set in
the way of truth before reaching thirty. If a
man is timorous before thirty, he will be an unmitigable
coward, perhaps knave, for the rest of
his days. And today the only profession which
demands any active spirit of heroism is the calling
of literature, that has become the <i>Deus ex
machina</i> of all modern civilized life.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_002.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Every truly ambitious writer, or for that matter,
every manly writer, be he a genius or a mediocrity,
has certain large ideal aims to serve
in all his literature. It is not enough for a manly
man to simply evoke applause. A nude nymph
from the gutter of Paris dancing a can-can on a
cafe table, also lives by popular suffrage, and
wins such popular approbation as is never given
to literature&mdash;the incoherent cries in which the
whole body emits its tingling void of aching,
sensuous delight, the deep, whole-hearted greed
of the flaming instincts and soul of the race.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>There are a thousand arts and tricks that gain
applause and good pay, and have the world&#8217;s
countenance (and ours, for we are not such rigid
moralists as to try to upset nature); but it is
the business of the artist to gain respect, not
for himself as an individual, for in that capacity
we can allow much to temptation, but for
his precious art, which is the voice of all the
dumb ones of our kind. Surely, if there is any
thing that Almighty God could forbear in tenderness
to destroy, of all man&#8217;s sad attempts to
win a home in this inhospitable world, it is the
written pages that hold the highest aspirations
of the human soul&mdash;some pages that we, in our
overweening pride in the glory of our fellows,
think hold a beauty and breadth that must partake
of Divinity itself. But the wind of deathless
Time is rushing even now, and we know
that nothing can escape its touch.</p>

<p>It is the final business of literature to quicken
the spirit of humanity and stir those noblest impulses
that make us despise the mere grovelling
life of those who have not learned the irony of
<i>things</i>. We hide ourselves like guilty creatures
among our dusty, dusty possessions, afraid to
waste time for living and thought, and so the
days and nights that should be ours pass and we
enjoy them not. Only a few poets possess the
days and nights, and even they know the sweetness
of life mostly in sorrow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>All literature is trivial that lacks this large
relevance to human life, and so, in looking over
the bulk of contemporary American literature,
it is to be feared that neither charity nor policy
can make it out to be very important. It is
destitute of any of the spirit of genius, and it is
for the most part merely a travesty of the small
talk of the surface life of so-called &#8220;good society.&#8221;
It nowhere touches upon the reality of
human passion, existent under every mask of
custom and artificial seeming of refinement, and
its inspiration is evident in every hasty line&mdash;money
and advertising.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>To be quite candid, could any other country
boast such an utterly mediocre, uninspired group
of literary artisans as is represented by the
Scratchback Club of New York, which in its
membership really furnishes all that passes for
contemporary &#8220;American&#8221; literature in our periodicals?
They show the intellectual and imaginative
poverty of a people merely pushing
and ingenious. They reveal the shallowness of
the prevailing idea that mere education furnishes
those deep forces of personality which have made
all true literature, and all true cultivation, with
or without education. There is none of the
audacity of real spontaneous thought in these
men and women&#8217;s work; it is all written to order,
as mechanically as an auctioneer&#8217;s catalogue.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>But it is well to have a definite aim in literature,
and the pens concerned in the production
of the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> are at least inspired by a sense
of the fluidity of this excellent medium of prose,
and though they may fail in the haste of periodical
writing to achieve the perfect ends of art,
at least they will not wantonly strive to debase
the public judgment and taste by pandering to
the narrow minds of ignorant prudes, after the
fashion of the popular periodical literature of
the day.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> has a definite aim and purpose
in being, and that is, to get more latitude in literature
written in English, and to make the work
of the real writers of our end of the century better
known to the great democracy of readers.
These are the younger men and not the old,
fogy carpenters, brought up to write moral tracts
under Dr. J. G. Holland at the close of the fifties.
The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> looks to the younger generation
to enable it to make its aims a force in our intellectual
and literary life here in America.</p>

<p>There is a revolt and a quickening sense of
changes and forces in the air. The work of any
individual writer or worker can effect little or
nothing. But the earnest enthusiasm of a little
band of men and women, inspired with a belief
in the impartiality of the good God and the perpetual
renewal of imagination and thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
genius in every branch of the race, can set such
an enthusiasm for better things and higher ideals
in not merely the substance but the spirit of all
our art endeavor as shall bring in a harvest of
real, robust literature from every quarter of this
country&mdash;largely from the most unsuspected
quarters. It is this scattered interest in a nobler
ideal than obtains in our contemporary periodical
literature that the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> will attempt to
focus. At present nearly all the writers with
any individual style and force and robustness
and largeness of aim are shut out of American
periodical literature, because such qualities in
literature are deemed <i>too shocking</i> nowadays.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> believes there are still readers
who appreciate boldness, original conceptions,
audacity of treatment, and the varied play of
fancy over the whole and not merely a part of
human existence. These are the qualities that
gave us our standard English literature, and in
the early days inspired our greatest writers in
America. They must be the impulse and inspiration
of today, if Americans are not content to
be represented in literature by snobbish boys
trying to write like &#8220;ladies,&#8221; and women who
write without effort like the deuce knows what.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>When we say we appeal to the younger people
it must not be thought that we appeal to the
children&mdash;although since they are so far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
critical than their grandparents, we shall not dare
to forget them altogether. We mean that we
desire to enlist the interests and sympathies of
our own generation&mdash;say those born sometime
in the sixties and since. Our grandparents may
be very good folk and quite smart in getting
around today, but they were largely brought up
on almanacs, and their literary tastes are narrow
and eccentric without being picturesque. They
belong to ancient times without holding the antique
novelties of the really far away ancient
times, which were really more in touch with the
intellectual bustle and eager curiosity of our day
than those gray years of smug Anglo-Saxon absorption
in a civilization of mere bread and beer
that lie immediately behind us, and still cast the
chill shadow of their prurient morality over all
our literature. Even some of the direct parents
of this generation are a little threadbare
in their craniums. They have read domestic
literature all their lives and of course are incapable
of thought. The stirring gray matter is
found in the heads of those born not much
further back, say, than &#8217;49, the year of gold.
Let us resolve to make this <i>fin de siecle</i> the
golden age of American literature. And if there
are, as I suspect there are, some belated grandparents
still on earth, animated with the spirit
and ideals of Milton and the Martyrs, young at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
heart in their enthusiasm for the truth, for the
art that touches and ennobles life, and for freedom
of thought and expression, these are of us
also, and will gladly find in the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>, in
its burst of youth, the ideals that have always
permeated robust and honest literature&mdash;especially
in the old days when a man might swing
or burn for an audacious pamphlet. With such
old fogies we have no bone of contention. But
the old fogies in petticoats, the gingerbread
writers, we shall probably toss up in a blanket
nine times as high as the moon&mdash;when we are
not so pressed for space and time.</p>

The weather was miserable, as Jurassic

<p>The Archaeopteryx was feeling pretty gloomy,
for at that morning&#8217;s meeting of the Amalgamated
Association of Enaliosaurians he had
been blackballed. He was looked down upon by
the Pterodactyl and the Ichthyosaurus deigned
not to notice him. Cast out by the Reptilia,

wanderer upon the face of the earth. &#8220;Alas!&#8221;

died; and became imbedded in the rock.</p>

<p>And ages afterward a featherless biped, called

our feathered flocks!&#8221; And they placed him

<h2 class="nobreak">ADONIS IN TATTERS.</h2></div>

<p class="center">A PARABLE ON THE POWER OF BEAUTY.</p>


<p>The audience at a parlor lecture in a Beacon
Street drawing room is apt to be rather intense
and rapt in its attention, and discreet in its enthusiasm,
with the emphasis of discernment
which subdued, well-bred applause confers. At
Mrs. Reginald Beveridge Vincent&#8217;s this is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
particularly noticeable, for Mrs. Vincent is one
of the social law givers of the &#8220;smart&#8221; set, and
her rooms on these occasions are thronged with
all sorts of ambitious social strugglers, who pay
insidious homage to their hostess in their admiration
of the idols for whom she stands sponsor.
There are all sorts of people here, and
among them many of the great army of the
small celebrities, who are somewhat more distinguished
than prosperous, and who would fain
pass from the appreciation of imaginative literature
to the serious consideration of dining. The
fact is, the socially nebulous, who rebel against
their birth&#8217;s invidious bar and strive to get out of
the obscurity of the mass of humanity, are really
the backbone of the enthusiasm for letters in
fashionable society. These rather dubious folk,
with no redeeming big bank account, are spurred
by ambition to attach themselves to some sort of
superiority&mdash;the superiority not always inherently
residing in them; and so literature becomes
their easy spoil. They constitute the
one stable element in all literary gatherings out
of Grub Street; and even Mrs. Vincent, with all
her social prestige, could not dispense with them.
And so they come, and dream of passing the
rubicon, and so on to more important functions.
There are many who are considered good enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and worthy to sit at a feast of reason and a flow
of soul, who would never be deemed eligible for
the holier function of stuffing with baked meats
and wines. These literary afternoons, it may be
noted, for the benefit of the ambitious, serve an
incidental purpose as a sort of preliminary investigation
into the character, standing and desirability
of new acquaintances. Many are called
to the feast of literature&mdash;but few are chosen to
break bread at dinner. But the success of parlor
lectures, at the most dispiriting hour of the
afternoon in winter when the city streets are
sunless and melancholy and depressing, depends
almost entirely upon the lure of social hopes,
that influence the more or less obscure to give
up the comfort of their mediocre leisure to swell
the triumph of those who secure the glory of
the passing show of life. The woman who
wants to shine as a patron of the fine arts must
not neglect these mixed social elements, or her
rooms will be empty. Exemplary activity in
church politics and an interest in letters, are the
humble beginnings, the corduroy roads, as it
were, of many who ultimately shine with more
certain lustre as leaders of the german. Therefore,
every wise blue stocking is affable and accessible
to the crowd of dubious persons whose
admirations may be depended upon&mdash;unless hope
burns stronger in some other quarter. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
thing is certain: the grand dames of the upper
social heavens are not to be depended upon when
literature or philosophy is the only attraction
offered, even when a grand dame is herself holding
the reception. There are so many petty
jealousies, and so many rival courts; and, moreover,
the grand dames have so many questions
of social diplomacy to occupy them&mdash;men, for
instance (<i>nice</i>, eligible men are scarce); consequently
they do not often come under the spell
of the literary impressario, who gains a precarious
subsistence in the lap of luxury; and, besides,
the afternoon is the meridian of the shopping
fever.</p>

<p>The large drawing room was crowded on this
particular afternoon, and Mrs. Vincent was in
high feather, for she had secured the new poet
of the season, Mr. Blanco Winterbourne, to give
his lecture on &#8220;Ideals of Beauty in Modern
Life.&#8221; This was in itself a victory. Winterbourne
was a brand new poet, who had dropped
straight from the skies and been immediately
accepted in London, so that he had all the freshness
and glamour of a debutante, and his reputation
being still in the making in the inner circles
of society, the gold dust was still upon his wings,
unbrushed and untarnished by the chill after-thoughts
of envious Grub Street criticism.</p>

<p>Everybody sat in an attitude of rare rapture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and every time the lecturer uttered some especially
well sounding and uplifting sentiment, and
paused a moment for the rapid click of eyes,
some fine idealist in the group would fix the
hostess&#8217;s wandering glance with a gleam of appreciation.
This was intended to isolate him in
her memory as a man of discernment and culture
worthy of remembrance in the Elysian domain
of dining. There is indeed something almost
pathetic in this intense concentration of mind,
this painful anxiety of appreciation, which is so
evidently the tribute to the hostess and not to
the new genius himself. Only so much rapture
goes to the lecturer as appearances demand.
The glory of the occasion belongs to the patron;
for skill and talent are largely a matter of labor
and discipline, whereas the recognition of excellence
is the quick flash of pure intellect, genius!
But the audience is charitable enough, and the
most terrible ordeal for the lecturer, fresh from
Parnassus or Grub Street, is the pervasive and
distracting rustling and swishing of silken skirts&mdash;a
sound that is the most tangible symbol of
women&#8217;s potent whims in the sensuous consciousness
of man.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>There was one exception to the general air of
complete absorption and satisfaction, and this
was a queer, oval cynical face, half in the light
of the waning day, and half in the shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the curtains. It belonged to a young man, who
leaned half forward in a rigid, high-backed chair,
and alternately glanced curiously from face to
face in the audience, and then turned completely
about and looked out across the bare tree-tops
of the Common. A look of weariness, and even
of contempt, crept about his eyes and mouth, as
certain high-flown phrases reached his ears.</p>

<p>Here is a bit of rapid rhetoric that evoked the
applause of the company, and made him only
curl his lip. &#8220;The dominion of beauty obtains
forever in the human heart, and so long as this
is so, no class nor humanity at large can be
utterly bad; for the discernment of beauty involves
the recognition of moral feeling. All
permanent beauty is essentially moral and is
sure of ready acceptance, especially among
women, in whom the religious instinct is
strongest. Modern life can never annihilate
this innate and instinctive perception of intellectual
nobility and pure beauty. Nay, since
the form is the body of the soul, the finest type
of pure physical beauty will always rightly command
our admiration. It breaks through all
creeds and castes, and holds the race in unity of
feeling and thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lecture closed in a culminating clapping
of hands, and the guests all moved forward to
congratulate the lecturer and the patron. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
young man turned and studied the different
groups with an amused smile.</p>

<p>A lady, who had been watching the young
man&#8217;s mocking comment on the scene in the
changing expression of his eyes and pursed lips,
suddenly arose from a divan in the angle of the
room, and crossed over to where he sat in the
afternoon twilight.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>She stopped him from arising with a gesture,
and sank down into a seat beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not seem particularly pleased with
Mr. Blanco Winterbourne&#8217;s lecture?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t interest me, because you
see I come into contact with life as it really is.
I have heard all this cant about the beauty of
purity and character before so many times, but
when I see beauty of character in life I find it
always taken advantage of. And as for the dignity
of physical beauty, I need scarcely tell one
of your sex the difference between a beauty in
rags and a beauty in silks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I protest, that although the world
is gross, and the half of us are mere Mammon
worshippers, there is an instinct of delight, and
irresistible attraction for us, especially for we
women, in sheer beauty without any trappings
of finery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed; that sounds like the magnanimity
of humanity, universally asserted by popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
moralists. But your sex is really the least
amenable, as I could easily prove to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, if you can put on your hat and coat
and come at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m in a blaze of curiosity for the adventure.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As they crossed Beacon Street a beggar boy
stepped up to them, and in piping tones of want
asked the lady for alms. She glanced for a moment
into his face with a blank look of negation
on her own, and with a sort of comprehensive
intake of his dirt and rags she gathered her
skirts about her and passed through the turnpike
and down the steps to the Common. But
her companion lingered behind, and presently
joined her, half dragging the boy by his tattered
sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, Miss Lorillard, and look at the
boy. I want to know if this isn&#8217;t beauty?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and looked into the boy&#8217;s face, as
her companion held it up to the light between
his two hands. The extraordinary and perfect
beauty of his features seized upon her in a sort
of wonderment. Where had she ever seen such
a face before?&mdash;And her memory swept through
the galleries of Europe. In none of them. How
was it she had not noticed it at first? The dirt?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
It was incomparable&mdash;it seemed superhuman in
its sweetness and beauty, its appeal, and its glow
of divinity. God&#8217;s hand was plainly set in that
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the boy,&#8221; said the young man, laconically,
watching her expression. &#8220;Come
along.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>And linking his arm in that of the ragged
youngster, the trio sauntered along with the
fashionable throng coming out of the matinees.</p>


<p>&#8220;Get out of my way, you ugly little sweep,&#8221;
said one woman, elbowing the boy off the pavement;
and the men pushed him hither and
thither. The fashionable women looked right
through the ragged urchin and his evidently dubious
companions, as if they were glass, and their
gaze seemed to bite like frost. Not one woman
remarked the surpassing loveliness of the boy&#8217;s
perfect face.</p>

<p>At the corner of the Common the young man
sent the boy about his business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he, and what does all this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Adonis&mdash;the one-time victor of
Venus. He fell upon evil days when clothes
made the king, and rags the knave.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sometimes think life is but a see-saw board,
with hope at one end and despair at the other.
First hope goes up, and despair goes down, and
then it reverses. There seems to be no break in
the steady rise and fall. We live on, clinging to
the belief that hope will outbalance despair, but
it does not, and men come and men go, and life
still teeters away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LITTLE GREEN HAT.</h2></div>


<p>They were coming out of the matinee, and
there was something in the way he took her arm
and swung her out of the crush, that the experienced
eye of the married man or married woman
could at once detect as the assurance of the husband,
accustomed to being adored, and quietly
and covertly conscious of other feminine eyes in
the crowd.</p>

<p>He turned up her fur collar and they walked
along in silence. She was scrutinizing each face
in the slowly moving throng. He was picking
his way, falling in her wake to give room to the
opposing stream, and occasionally to glance behind
and strengthen some impression of a silhouette,
that awoke a momentary pang, and then
faded into the blur of faces, the rustle of silks
and the subtle perfume of a well dressed crowd of
women.</p>

<p>Once he turned half round sharply, as a tall,
handsome woman swept by, creaking and rustling
like a great galleon in a swell of wind and
rolling sea. His wife brought back his eyes
with a glance of interrogation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty little green hat, that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
think it would just suit you.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE NEW GOD.</h2></div>


<p>It is altogether fitting and proper, as Abraham
Lincoln would say if he were not dead, that
that there should be an immediate definition of
the &#8220;New God.&#8221; It is not easy to define the
New Woman&mdash;not easy to define the New Man,
nor to formulate New Ideas, but, in these days,
when the passion for money getting over-shadows
everything else in life, and colors our
religion and philosophy, with the cheap cynicism
of poor cheated greed, it is easy to define the
New God. In the first place, He is everything
that the Old God was not; and that is saying
everything that the Modern Dives wishes said&mdash;and
for which he pays his preacher. The
successful modern preacher has to be a man of
great intellectual parts, and some knowledge of
affairs. He must be a man of the world, for it
is the function of a new prophet in a successful
metropolitan church to preach the New God.
And this is most effectively done while occupying
the Old Pulpit. An adroit and conservative
judicial spirit has entirely renovated and made
respectable the gift of prophecy in the Christian
church. So we see the churches filled with the
social charity of sweet and silken equality, and
all things are kept as sweet and peaceful as
possible in this atmosphere that once reeked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with sulphurous fumes for the wicked. But
the sweet savor of camphor and smelling salts
has stifled the sulphur,&mdash;and all other disagreeable
odors in God&#8217;s House.</p>

<p>The churches of today are mostly mausoleums
in which rest the crumbling remains of the
ancient God. But an intellectual age still delights
in the glamor of impressive ritual, and
his name and attributes are enshrined in Creed,
Decalogue and Hymn. But the old Law is serenely
disobeyed, with the assurance that the
New God is much too good or much too distant
to perplex himself with the peccadillos of good
society. As a certain French countess said in
the court of Louis XV., &#8220;The good God would
surely think twice before damning people of
quality&#8221;&mdash;and undoubtedly the New God is
more liberal and refined than the old one.</p>

<p>The New God, like the cynic man of the world,
takes the world as he finds it. He is a being of
an infinite indifference to syndicates (<i>sin</i>-di-cates!),
deals (in which lurks the de&#8217;il!), coal
oil monopolies (whence come endowments that
throttle free speech on social questions), sugar
trusts (that capture Congress), and the ways of
a man with a maid&mdash;or, what is quite as wonderful&mdash;the
ways of a new maid with an old
man.</p>

<p>The New God is a dilettante in religion, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
winks (when bribed with a good service in a fine
church) and looks the other way when broad-cloth
and satin sow unto the flesh.</p>

<p>It is to be suspected that the New Girl in her
way is better than the New God. If the New
Man becomes any worse, he ought to&mdash;well, it
would be impolitic to say what he ought to do.
But between the New God and the cynics of
Mammon this world does not seem to promise
the millennium or Utopia just yet a while.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SCHOOL OF NECESSITY.</h2></div>


<p>If we are to come into our inheritance as an
artistic people, let us hear less of Art with a
big A. Let us turn from the oracle of the Personally
Conducted and make bonfires of our
Baedeckers.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Old Masters&#8221; were plain men, for the
most part, with the virtues and vices of their
time, and would kill a man or paint a Madonna
with equal skill and enthusiasm. Art was to
them only one form of a manifold activity, not
a problem to be solved nor a fetish to be worshipped.
Cellini made salt cellars and bragged
about them long before he cast his Perseus.
Michaelangelo painted the Sistine ceiling because
the Pope commanded him, and not because
he was divinely inspired to do it. Raphael and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Rubens ran picture factories which turned out
paintings of a certain brand, like so many barrels
of flour. Shakespeare patched together
threadbare scenes and situations for special occasions,
as managers now prepare a Christmas
pantomime; and Balzac wrote the &#8220;Comedie
Humaine&#8221; to pay his debts.</p>

<p>Literature is not a thing of limited editions,
nor painting of spring exhibitions. While you
are seeking the coming novelist between rich
covers he may be doing a daily &#8220;story&#8221; for
some sensational morning paper; and the new
Raphael you think of as hid away in some
sequestered north-lit studio may be designing
labels for boxes in a lithograph factory.</p>

<p>Respect, therefore, the poster, though it <i>is</i>
obtrusive, and despise not the Japanese print,
though it be cheap. Admit that there is more
merit in the pen and ink picture of which are
printed a million copies, than in the etching on
your library walls, of which there are only ten.</p>

<p>Believe that the baths and aqueducts of Rome,
however marvellous, are puerile as feats of
engineering compared with a city floated on
Lake Michigan mud; and learn that while you
drowse over your &#8220;standard authors&#8221; of today
the work of him who will be the standard author
of tomorrow may be appearing in these despised
pages.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BUBBLE AND SQUEAK.</h2></div>


<p>Let the world wag as it may, the wits must live
by waggery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The optimists who are so comfortably situated
that they can support optimism without any severe
strain upon their imaginations, say, &#8220;What
is, is right.&#8221; But they fail to tackle the corollary
proposition, &#8220;What isn&#8217;t, isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I received a book the other day from one of
the leading publishers for review, and for three
days and nights I have labored with it. It is one
of those dull and dreary affairs, without even the
single redeeming grace of conscious striving egotism,
and it is written by one of the most prominent
members of the New York Scratchback
Club, a man whose name is in everybody&#8217;s mouth
in the country. I wrote a scorching review of the
book, in my happiest vein of gory glee; but upon
reflection I shall not print it. This author is too
infernally stupid to deserve so good an &#8220;ad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poets are not the only sufferers in these
sober strenuous days, in which the beautiful
distractions of idleness are not properly understood
or appreciated. Full many a wag is born
to waste his wit upon the desert air&mdash;or the
thick skull of an anthropoid on the &#8220;night desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been suggested by an undiscouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
friend of humanity that, at the close of the Age
of Consent discussion, a committee should be organized
among the society women who live in
the highly fashionable locality in Boston that is
honored with the presence of Mrs. Helen H. Gardener,
to raise necessary funds to defray the cost
of giving the sources of this lady&#8217;s literary inspiration
a good Spring cleaning. He urges,
and with some apparent show of reason, that
after her arduous labors as the historian of
the Age of Consent movement, Mrs. Gardener
cannot wait until spring, and her consent should
be sought at an early date. Mrs. Gardener is
well known as a sort of social tornado in fiction,
though I believe she claims to belong to the Red
Cross or Sanitary school of writers. She is,
anyhow, the head and front of the inodorous infliction
called the Age of Consent agitation, and
the author of that delightfully aromatic literary
confection&mdash;you should read it held off in a pair
of tongs&mdash;&#8220;Is this your son, my Lord?&#8221; We
can say with <i>empressement</i>, no, thank God! This
particular kind of pathological fiction is only
possible to a certain haunted, morbid feminine
imagination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hall Caine tells young authors that when they
are tempted to describe a scene of more than
usual delicacy to refrain from it, if it is not absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
necessary to the story. What about writing
your story around a delicate situation, as
Shakespeare did in &#8220;The Rape of Lucrece&#8221;? A
delicate situation, delicately expressed, requires
more talent than an indelicate one indelicately
described.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great many readers of the powerful poem
called &#8220;The Wail of the Hack Writer&#8221; in this
issue, picturing a mood of revulsion and despair
common enough among all writers who have to
earn a livelihood by the pen, will be surprised in
coming upon the name of the author, Sam Walter
Foss. This is an interesting phase of personality.
This poem reveals a new and serious
personality in a writer already known to a wider
circle of readers than few of us can ever hope to
reach. For years the name of Sam Walter Foss
has been synonymous with the most bubbling
humor and spontaneous, genial fun. One could
guess this man took life smiling from the laugh
in all his work, and his optimistic, large belief
in his fellows. And the superficial reader,
caught with these merry jingles and this good-natured
philosophy, might naturally think that
Mr. Foss was a man who took all life as a joke,
who hated serious books, and never saw the sad
side of life. The optimism of the man is in his
work, but it is not a narrow optimism, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
this light fun is born of a deep and serious interest
in the human drama being played out today.
The man himself is a serious man in all
his ideas and interests in life, and there is a
serious undercurrent of purpose in all his fun
making.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yvette Guilbert, the famous Paris chanteuse,
who is now singing at the Olympia in New
York, is said to give in her repertoire some humorous
songs with more point in them than our
English speaking audiences are accustomed to.
As two thirds of her English speaking audiences
will not be able to thoroughly understand her,
even those who can read and speak French being
unable to follow it closely when sung, it
must be interesting to watch the faces of her
audiences. While Mlle. Guilbert is singing her
sweet ditties of love-lorn maiden&#8217;s hopes and
trials, it is ten to one the greater part of her audience
will be imagining all sorts of wicked, depraved
things are being publicly sown in the
hearts of our innocent people. London has pronounced
her songs shocking. We can scarcely expect
Mlle. Guilbert will be much better understood
on this side, for the Anglo-Saxon has rarely
the temperament to catch the play of Gallic humor.
So half the audience will sit and dream in
abandonment of the wicked things wicked people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
are reported to do; and those who are so fortunate
as to have wicked thoughts of their own
will think them, and Mlle. Guilbert will have to
bear all their blushes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> appeals to the Young Man
and Young Woman&#8217;s sense of humor. It is
time some of us youngsters were allowed to belong
to some generation, and if we do not assert
our right to be <i>now</i>, we shall experience some
difficulty in squeezing into the ranks of the generations
unborn. The old fogies fail to see the
reasonableness of this. If the younger generation
also fails to perceive our right to exist, it
will bring our gray hairs in sorrow to the grave&mdash;for
we are but belated boys, after all. This is
a world in which it takes one a long while to
grow up, when one is poor&mdash;especially in Grub
Street.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I get so poor that I cannot afford to
buy any more clothes, I intend to dress in <i>Fly
Leaves</i>, as I believe this badge of honorable endeavor
will save me somewhat from the scoffs
of the mob, in a community that holds letters
in the high esteem they are held in Boston.
Then when I am dead and gone ten cities will
contend for the honor of my birth. I never tell
where I was born. It is unwise; for people will
never forgive the impertinence of your being
born among them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>All these personal notes are relevant in up-to-date
journalism, because this is an age of confidences;
and not to let the public know all about
one&#8217;s private life is to argue one&#8217;s self unknown.
I may begin on my autobiography in earnest, in
a little while. I have &#8220;Passions&#8221; in great number
and variety.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To J. W. S.: No, my dear friend, I sympathize
with your ambition, but you cannot bribe the
Editor of the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> with any such consideration
as a year&#8217;s subscription to print your Ode.
We have not yet been tempted, as some of our
popular contemporaries are every month, with
an offer to purchase an edition of fifty thousand
and dine the editor; but conscious virtue inclines
us to repudiate your one dollar and get the
full credit of it with posterity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A young lady writes to me from a western city
and encloses her photograph, which shows her
to be a blooming, chubby-cheeked beauty of
eighteen summers. She says, in her letter, she
is studying very hard and sitting up night after
night until daybreak, reading all the great
authors of our era: E. P. Roe, Edward W.
Bok, Richard Harding Davis and Dr. J. G. Holland,
with the intention of adopting literature as
a career. These are all truly &#8220;great masters,&#8221;
and their selection shows an unerring judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in one contemplating a career in <i>American</i> contemporary
literature. I made the mistake of
choosing certain obscure Elizabethans and seventeenth
century Englishmen as my masters;
and so have never got out of Grub Street. A
woman can scarcely offend against the canons
of morality if she models her ideals of fictitious
propriety after the examples of these litterateurs
who have made simpering the grace and distinction
of our epoch. It was unkind of fate to deny
these great minds the innocency of petticoats,
but they have remained wonderfully unspotted
from the world. They have reduced all morality
to etiquette. But I am afraid my young lady
will spoil her beauty with all this strain to rid
her mind of original predilections after the
manner of these &#8220;masters,&#8221; and she may develop
that shocking severity of countenance,
which is so appallingly rife among our female
moralists in any illustrated book catalogue. All
women are beautiful, of course; but those who
try to look like seers in their photographs usually
look as if life were a perpetual washing day
with them. It seems that scribbling often fatally
undermines geniality in the female temperament,
and indeed most women write novels because
they lack a sense of humor. This severe superciliousness
of our female celebrities, I hold, is a
warning to the New Woman to cultivate flippant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
male society as much as possible. I warn
my correspondent not to grow a face that appals
young love and stops clocks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <i>Arena</i> should not hide its light under a
bushel. It should put out a sign, &#8220;Worlds reformed
while you wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actress who finds herself too fat to be cast
for the heroine (heroines are always slender)
and has to thin down upon a diet of nothing but
beef tea and hot water with a squeeze of lemon
in it for three months, buys fame almost as
dearly as do the poets. Ambition seems to have
a trick of cheating the stomach; but asceticism
and mortification of the flesh on the stage have
strangely enough made their belated appearance
with the advent of The Woman who Did.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The great trouble with human nature is that
it is everywhere. If it were only confined like a
mad dog and rampaged solely in one country or
continent, we could take ideal views of life.
And we could be patriots without being scoundrels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the sentimental: Please do not forget that
it was Dr. Johnson and not the writer who said
&#8220;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LONDON ACADEMY</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The Leading Critical Literary Journal of London,
in a long review of &#8220;<span class="smcap">Meditations in
Motley</span>,&#8221; by <span class="smcap">Walter Blackburn Harte</span>,
says, among other things:</p></blockquote>


<p>&#8220;When any book of good criticism comes it should be welcomed
and made known for the benefit of the persons who care
for such works. The book under notice is one of these. It is,
so far as I know, the first from the author&#8217;s pen; but his writings
are well known, and those who read his present book will, with
some eagerness, await its successor. For it is a book in which
wit and bright, if often satirical, humor are made the vehicle for
no flimsy affectations, but for genuine thought. Mr. Ruskin has
affirmed that the virtue of originality is not newness, but genuineness.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this true sense Mr. Harte&#8217;s book is original. Here is
his own thought on several topics, pleasantly displayed, and no
mere echo or second-hand production of the ideas of others. If
Mr. Harte continues to act up to this sentiment, [a long quotation
from the book under consideration] as he does in the present
book, he may not achieve the triumph of twentieth editions, but
he will be a power for good&mdash;as every true man of letters is, and
must be in the world. If it were practicable I should be much
disposed to let the author recommend himself by giving copious
quotations from these essays. At his best&mdash;that is, in his most
characteristic and seemingly unconscious passages&mdash;he reminds
one of Montaigne: the charming inconsequence, the egotism free

<p>Some wicked nurses lull crying, starving children by putting
the rubber bulb of an empty nursing bottle into their mouths.
This fills the babe with evil wind and destroys its judgment,
character, digestion and intellect. The old fashioned popular
periodicals do the same thing for inquiring and curious minds,
seeking nourishment and amusement. They give them a bottle
of windy pap, called <i>nice, pure domestic literature</i>, and the
result is the same as with the poor baby&mdash;only aggravated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span> is a robust, masculine, periodical for grown-up,
common sense young men and women. It takes the point
of view of the young man of today in literature and life. It is
new, but sane. Its audacity is integrity of opinion and not mere
eccentricity. It advocates greater freedom in American literature,
and it discusses the aims and tendencies of the new movement
and new writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span> is young, but not such a cherub that it lacks
wisdom teeth, and those who appreciate waggery are laughing
over its little ironies. It is certain the new babe can live by its
wits very well in a community which appreciates wit as keenly
as does the great American public.</p>
